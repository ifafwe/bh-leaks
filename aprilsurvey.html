If you&rsquo;re noticing things like favouritism, people excluding others in MRL then you&rsquo;re more than welcome to report these things. Now, I know you might be thinking but what if it&rsquo;s an HR then they&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;ve reported them, you no longer have to worry about that as we&#39;re going to open another form where you all may report things. There will be an option to if you want to be anonymous or not however do remember that if you stay anonymous, there&rsquo;s no way for us to ask questions or ask you to explain further so keep that in mind if you&rsquo;re staying anonymous.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A slight bias in regards to LR promotions, in the nicest way possible it seems that the more sociable and talkative LRs are ones that are completely ignored, there are many LRs that i personally think are long overdue a head position, and i&#39;ve personally noticed that it usually tends to be the quieter ones that receive recognition</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">I&rsquo;m glad that you bring this up, as an HR we&rsquo;re probably not going to see these things as easily as you will. Although I will mention that for some LRs we do have to make sure that if they&rsquo;re joining the MR team that they&rsquo;ll be able to stick to the standards that we have. Sometimes even us HRs need just a bit of a wake-up call and for someone to say to us this person deserves a promotion.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">during the mr meeting back in december mrs we told we would be engaged in a lot more community events. i completely understand some of the hrs may be unavailable but there has to be a time when you are available. even if its weekly puzzle of some sorts to engage the community. it also touches on alliance events occurring, i feel we should be hosting more events.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">I 100% agree with you on this, we&rsquo;re going to work on being more involved in the community and alliances. It&rsquo;s important to have good relationships with our alliances and that&rsquo;s something we aim to work on. And of course, having more things like May madness.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I have seen at trainings ranks 3 who are under the age 15, and to be honest, it was not rare.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">If you notice this, bring it up with an HR so we can demote them or if they haven&rsquo;t been ranked yet then you&rsquo;re more than welcome to notify the host.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I also believe the discord bans are a tad unfair, you cannot just ban someone because you dislike them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Honestly, I haven&rsquo;t seen this myself, we don&rsquo;t just go banning people for the fun of it, we need actual proof to be able to ban so it would be quite hard to ban for the fun of it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I feel as if the activity of HR&rsquo;s and the senior team is extremely low</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">As for the activity within the HR team, I can promise you that we&rsquo;re getting this sorted and you will see a huge change in activity, that could be with sessions, public events, private events etc. As of the Senior team, without leaking, they are allowed to go on inactive notices and we have plans to ensure that everyone is doing the required amount of work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As well as suspending without proof, you cannot take someone&rsquo;s word for something just because you dislike the person being reported.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">For every suspension, we have proof. There&rsquo;s no way we can suspend someone because we dislike them. To give you an insight on how suspensions are determined, we need opinions from multiple HRs and a final decision from a BOD on what should be done about their certain situation. If there were to ever be a case of an HR trying to suspend someone without proof, it simply wouldn&rsquo;t work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Same for unbanning, you will unban someone who&rsquo;s done much worse just because you&rsquo;re friends with someone or dislike the person.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">The unbanning process for people who have done major things is pretty much the same for the suspending process, we need multiple opinions in order for the person to be unbanned. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">There has also been a rise in HRs allowing friends to assist with promotions, which perhaps others would like to do too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">I completely understand this, if I&rsquo;m promoting someone then I&rsquo;ll try my best to at least get their friends in the server, it&rsquo;s up to the HRs on how they want to promote and who they&rsquo;d like to get involved but there&rsquo;s always the fear of the person telling their friend they&rsquo;re getting promoted, I know a lot of you wouldn&rsquo;t want to ruin it for them however it&rsquo;s always a fear no matter what.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Lastly, I just feel extremely unappreciated as an mr. I feel like we dont really get credited for what we do and all our hard work could be gone in an instant with one mistake</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">We give a lot of chances before things like a demotion or termination can happen, as long as you guys tell us things then your consequences won&rsquo;t be as severe, like if you were to accidentally kick all, we won&rsquo;t demote/terminate you for it even if you didn&rsquo;t tell us unless it was used to abuse and not an accident. We understand mistakes, they happen to us too.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I, myself, have tried talking to some HRs when they are in lounge and they just flat out ignore that I said anything, even if I reply to them so they get a ping, yet they will continue the conversation they were having with a different MR+</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Please hold people accountable for this kind of stuff, especially if it&rsquo;s an HR, now that we&rsquo;re opening the report form which can be anonymous I feel like it would be easier for you guys to bring this stuff up so we&rsquo;re aware and can take the actions needed, we&rsquo;ve announced inclusion 3 times and if HRs aren&rsquo;t even following this then MRs will also think they </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">don&rsquo;t have to.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">From reading through over 134 responses throughout all 3 sections, the topic about feeling excluded was probably said the most. It&rsquo;s sad that so many of you guys feel this way and we&rsquo;ve really tried to help with all these announcements. We really can&rsquo;t force you all to be friends but I agree with a lot of you when you say that things are done on purpose like bringing group chats into MRL, somewhere you know not everyone can see and even I find that frustrating. Hopefully, this is something that will get better over time especially with the new report form that I mentioned earlier!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">I do feel that the ticket system is not explained well enough when an HR </span><span class="c7">is going</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;over the rules and basic information after being promoted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">This is something we&rsquo;re actively sorting out, for HRs we&rsquo;re going to have a guideline for promotion guides (for every rank), so everything that is needed is in there but they&rsquo;re still allowed to change it and word everything how they&rsquo;d like but still having every point included. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Whenever I join the hotel and there is another MR ( or maybe two other MRs ) I&rsquo;ll notice them standing around, when there is no housekeeper. I understand if the hotel is busy and they need to assist, but most of the time it is chill</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Again with the new form, you can hold people accountable with things like this because it&rsquo;s been announced before, if it&rsquo;s not busy then they need to be helping out at different stations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">if you accidentally leak a channel or something like that and get terminated, I don&rsquo;t find it fair</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">If you accidentally leak a channel or the contents of it, you won&rsquo;t get terminated unless we can tell that you&rsquo;re intentionally doing it in a way that is intended to break our rules, so for example, if I were to go to my LRs friends DMs and go showing them entire conversations in MR lounge then yes we would then probably terminate that person. You&rsquo;re told when going through rules that you cannot leak. However, there has been times where people have thought certain things are fine as long as it doesn&rsquo;t show the MR lounge name, this isn&rsquo;t the case but we wouldn&rsquo;t terminate you for this. There&rsquo;s also been cases where people have accidentally said MR channels in public voice calls, you won&rsquo;t get terminated for this, just tell an HR, we understand, it happens. Everything is dealt with on a case by case basis.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">&mdash; Questions Section :</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">What</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the future of the community events/alliance events?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This is a great question and I&rsquo;m glad someone has mentioned it! As of recently, we&rsquo;re really going to try to sort a lot out within the HR team and one of those is community events and alliance events. Personally, I think we should be more involved with alliances so in the future, we can all hopefully look forward to having some kind of </span><span class="c1">events</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with alliances. The same goes with community events, if any of you remember May madness, that will hopefully make a return (just maybe not in May..!).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Why do you not treat everyone equally?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Treating everyone equally, there were tons of complaints about the [NAME] situation being for HRs friends and the complaints about that are completely understandable, as you know, we&rsquo;ve stopped changing display names and that shouldn&rsquo;t happen again unless it&rsquo;s for something like April fools where everyone&rsquo;s would be changed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Multiple &ldquo;liked/popular&rdquo; threats to our community still have access to break rule 5 multiple times and somehow are still </span><span class="c7">in our</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;server? Why does this happen to be a pattern with multiple threats who are close with certain HRs?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The only situation I can currently think of would be with Flour (</span><span class="c1">Flxourrr</span><span class="c2 c1">), to give you all some information about Flour&rsquo;s ban, they were banned for 3 warnings for rule 5 however they were unbanned the next day. I promise this wasn&rsquo;t anything biassed, I understand how you could assume that however, Flour actually made a ticket asking to appeal her warnings, the ticket was answered and then Flour sent the appeal for warnings she could appeal for, the ticket ended up being ignored/missed by the HRs for 15 days. So, that was definitely something we messed up on and so that was why Flour was unbanned.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">What measures have been put in place to ensure the HR team follows basic rules for any community and we don&rsquo;t see the behaviour repeated?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Overall since the December incident, there&rsquo;s been no trash talking, if there were to be any incidents like that, there&rsquo;s no way it would be allowed and it would be reported to either a BOD or the founders. We want to be more open with the MR team and let you know what you can improve on (if there is anything) through reminders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were to ever receive a reminder, don&rsquo;t be too worried about it, we simply just want the best for you. To wrap this question up, I just want to say that personally I think the HR team at the moment is doing so much better and we&rsquo;ve definitely seen improvements within ourselves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">What happens if there is an emergency and we have no time to ask to leave a session, will we still get in trouble?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">You would not get into trouble! If you have to leave as soon as possible, just notify your host whenever you can, saying that you had an emergency and didn&rsquo;t have the time to explain why you left. Completely understandable, you won&rsquo;t get into trouble.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">When are we bringing back themed sessions?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">There was a reason that we stopped doing as many themed sessions as we used to. Themed sessions will become more of a rare thing or for major holidays.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">What steps have been taken to rebuild confidence in the high rank team?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s been many changes within the HR team and we&rsquo;re still working on a lot of them. You&rsquo;ll hopefully notice a lot of changes soon, there will be more structure for the HR team </span><span class="c1">which </span><span class="c2 c1">overall we believe will help increase the HR teams activity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Why has nothing changed since the last MR meeting? What is being missed and why hasn&#39;t it been fixed?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">I think this is due to a number of things, people being busy, maybe not knowing where to start, not getting the help that they need, there could be a number of things that&rsquo;s been holding people back from wanting to make change. I can assure you now though, change is happening.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Having an updated promotions board on trello so we can see any missed promotions/resignations along with people&rsquo;s months, etc.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">This was actually something I knew was already a thing however it&rsquo;s not official and it isn&rsquo;t updated too much, it&rsquo;s updated but it could be updated more.

We&rsquo;ve all been working on other things that will change the group for the better. So saying that we&rsquo;re doing all of this for false hope is quite disrespectful considering the amount of effort that is going into all of this. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">this group is corrupt to be honest. :/</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">I will assume you&rsquo;re the same person who said the complaint I stated above, if you really think this group is corrupt and we&rsquo;re giving false hope then I think it&rsquo;s time for you to really think about why you&rsquo;re working here and if it&rsquo;s worth it for you. If you think so negatively, why do you keep yourself in this environment?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">why aren&rsquo;t we allowed to talk about formers in mr-lounge? if I mention some of my former friends all the hrs ignore it. all of the hrs mention none of the formers with bad reputations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;re allowed to talk about </span><span class="c1">formers</span><span class="c2 c1">. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s exactly fair to say ALL HRs ignore it, I can&rsquo;t remember anyone asking me about any formers. I think it&rsquo;s common sense to not bring up people with a bad reputation, you don&rsquo;t want to be reminded of some of the things they&rsquo;ve done in certain cases. If you&rsquo;re bringing up someone with a bad reputation, you don&rsquo;t want it to possibly end up leading into trash talking, if they&rsquo;re someone in the community that has caused issues then people are going to have opinions and it could even make them uncomfortable speaking about it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">why don&rsquo;t you </span><span class="c7">give terminated</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">mrs</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;their former role? they were still a former and still contributed to this group. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">They purposely went out of their way to break rules we have, they can always appeal for their former MR role. If you have the former role, you&rsquo;re still somewhat representing us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">why don&rsquo;t you terminate inactive hrs? </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Terminations with HRs must go through Baby and Bear. Although, we are working on activity within the HR team.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Why do you let hrs who participate in trash talking make trash talking announcements? </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">People learn and change for the better, there hasn&rsquo;t been any trash talking since that incident.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">a former mr said this on their resignation letter about promotion and favouritism, &ldquo;i feel that there are personal favourite mrs among hrs. just my personal opinion.&rdquo; first question, with all honesty, would you guys say that this is completely false?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Of course we have our friends that are MRs but I wouldn&rsquo;t say people really have favourites that they&rsquo;d do more for.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">second question, does the &ldquo;hrs personal eye&rdquo; within the promotion standards include the fact that you like this person better so they get promoted even if this other one works (even for the tiniest difference) harder and have been working longer?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Definitely not! We take a lot into consideration (especially for promotions to Senior and Shift) and I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s more of a favourite, they can always get promoted another time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">third question, how exactly do promotions work beyond what&rsquo;s written on the operations board trello? please elaborate thank you!!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">There was an announcement about this to MRs quite a while ago, I&rsquo;ll give you all the link but will summarise the announcement anyway: When promoting, we don&rsquo;t just go promote the person, we need multiple HRs opinions on the person and for them to agree with the promotion. Promotions can&rsquo;t happen within 1 day, it can take 2 or more so every HR has the opportunity to say their opinion (if they want to). The promotion then finally has to be approved by a BOD.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">&mdash; Suggestions Section :</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Training guides could be more up-to-date with a lot of the new information that has been implemented.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">100% will be done!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">So as a suggestion maybe us heads/management can ask for permission in #mr-discussion to server ban someone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">This would be something we would have to get permission from Baby and Bear, I honestly can&rsquo;t see managers or heads ever being able to server ban. Do remember though that you can ping seniors and HRs as long as we don&rsquo;t have dnd in our status, if we&rsquo;re on dnd (the red circle) then that is fine.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">&mdash; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">There was a suggestion to make the warning system stricter, I don&rsquo;t think this would happen as I know Baby and Bear want things to be more lenient. However, if this is something you&rsquo;re all finding too stressful, I&rsquo;m sure we could come up with something and mention it to Baby and Bear.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">You&rsquo;re all probably wondering why I&rsquo;ve not mentioned something very important and it was actually in all 3 sections quite a bit, so I&rsquo;ll happily address that now&hellip;! Updates /V7! We&rsquo;ve had this current hotel version since 2019 and like a lot of you, I&rsquo;d love some change too. Myself and a few other HRs talked to Baby and Bear about what the future could hold for us regarding new updates and things. I&rsquo;m happy to tell you all that there may be some things to look forward to in the summer. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">There were some suggestions that were only mentioned once but still were extremely useful and we&rsquo;re actually making changes with. The first one being that receptionists are no longer allowed to work at the bar. They&rsquo;re not trained for it so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for them to be able to work both jobs. So from now on, if any receptionists ask if they&rsquo;re allowed to work at the bar, tell them that they&rsquo;re no longer allowed and they can move to a different server.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The second change being that LRs are no longer able to be kicked for hinting to help/train at </span><span class="c1">trainings</span><span class="c1">. It&rsquo;s a hidden rule that I&rsquo;m sure not a lot of our younger members know about and it&rsquo;s understandable to want to help at </span><span class="c1">trainings</span><span class="c2 c1">. Let&rsquo;s be honest, they all do and that&rsquo;s fine. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p></body></html>
