:bloxton3: **CALLING PEOPLE OUT** :bloxton3

Greetings @MR Team!
It's come to the HR teams attention that some MRs+ are pointing or calling out people's mistakes in ##mi-lounge. While it's perfectly fine to tell someone when they've made a mistake, please DM them about it in the future instead of saying their mistake in #mi-lounge . If their
DMs are closed, you may then ping them and tell them or ask them to open DMs. The reason for this change is So people are more comfortable and don't have tobe pinged multiple times in front of everyone regarding a mistake they made. It can make them feel embarrassed about a
minor mistake that can be very easily corrected.

If you have any questions, feel free to ping me or another HR!

React below once you've acknowledged and understand this announcement.

It has come  to the High-Rank team['s] attention within members of the MR team leaving sessions before it has started to answer a ticket request down at the hotel. This causes major issues for those who are already in a server that happens to be full, struggling to get a spot back into
that server or another Middle-rank member has taken the spot which means max limits are full.

The High-Rank team has decided to not allow Middle-rank members to respond to a ticket while in a session server. This isto prevent the struggles of trying to get back into a server or having someone take your spot. No one should be answering a ticket while waiting for the session
to start or during a session. If you happen to be dismissed from a session once your group has finished, you can answer al the tickets you want. You shouldn't be asking the host if you can go respond toaticket, then asking for them to slock the server for you since you need to rejoin.

I hope this clears up any confusion for those who were wondering if this was permitted or we had an update response on this. I you happen to have any questions, comments, or concems, feel free to ping me or another HR in #mr-discussion! Thanks for reading, have a lovely
Sunday! [HALF A HEART, HOLLOW]
